> reveal.js flashcard set for Japanese Vocab

Because every time I go to Japan I need to refresh my brain's hashmap cache of `map[concept] -> the foreign word for that concept`.

Ideally once I'm actually fluent in another language, my brain will be smart enough to section that one off from all of the other "not english" languages I know parts of, allowing me to slip into fluency whenever I want. But until then, my brain feels content to give me "english" and "every other language" as options for communication, so I frequently use the wrong particles and sentence structure when swapping languages.

But until then I can write code to fix my problems.

## Usage

I've already committed the md file created after downloading and parsing all of the japanese vocab, so please don't ddos that website that's hosting it. You can also just run

```bash
make open-vocab
```

To open the flashcard set in your web browser.

If you want to recreate the vocab set and re-shuffle the order, run

```
make all
```
